# Analog-Calculator
It is a Hardware system that can mimic the working of an Analog Calculator. The system is capable of processing different arithmetic expressions on command.
## Specifications
-The arithmetic expression to be evaluated is communicated to the hardware through a wireless IR Module.                                                                       
-The expression contains four operators: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and radication (N<sup>th</sup> root), which will be calculated in a calculator style following the BODMAS rule.\
-The operations are executed using hardware consisting of discrete analog components (Op-Amps, transistors) and we used ADC, DAC, and some ICs only for communication purposes.
